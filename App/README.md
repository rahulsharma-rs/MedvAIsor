# MedvAIsor App GBM Case Study
The MedvAIsor tool is the main contribution of this Hackathon project, where we developed the web-based software to screen GBM cancer cell lines (657 Genes; see Table 4). The tool deploys the ML model developed for Personalized drug screening (described in the previous section).  The input to the MedvAIsor App is a CSV file containing a header depicting the ‘SAMPLE_ID’, and 657 gene names (as mentioned in Table 4). To use the tool got this link https://esaghapour-bokeh-test-example-w7iblm.streamlitapp.com/ , upload the sample CSV (AllGE_GBM_657.csv) file in the github of MedvAisor/App, and watch the video tutorial named Tutorial_MedvAIsor.webm in the MedvAIsor/App repository location.
